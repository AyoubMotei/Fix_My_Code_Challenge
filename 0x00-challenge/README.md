Fix My Code Challenge
Welcome to the Fix My Code Challenge repository! This repository contains a series of programming tasks where something is going wrong in the provided code. Your task is to identify the issues and fix them. Let's dive into the challenges:

Task 0: FizzBuzz
Check out my implementation of FizzBuzz in Python (source code). But there's a problem...

$ ./0-fizzbuzz.py 50
1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 Fizz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz Fizz 22 23 Fizz Buzz 26 Fizz 28 29 Fizz 31 32 Fizz 34 Buzz Fizz 37 38 Fizz Buzz 41 Fizz 43 44 Fizz 46 47 Fizz 49 Buzz
$
It looks like the output is not as expected. Can you spot the issue? The number 15 should print FizzBuzz, not Fizz.

Task 1: Print Square
Explore my implementation of printing a square in Javascript (source code). But, there's a glitch...

$ ./1-print_square.js 10

$
The command ./1-print_square.js 10 should print a square of size 10, but it's not working as intended.

Task 2: Sort
Take a look at my sorting implementation in Ruby (source code). However, there's a hiccup...

$ ruby 2-sort.rb 12 41 2 C 9 -9 31 fun -1 32
31
32
12
41
2
9
-9
-1
$
The sorting output is not quite right. Can you figure out the issue?

Task 3: User Password
Inspect my User class implementation in Python (source code). Something isn't quite working...

$ ./3-user.py 
Test User
is_valid_password should return True if it's the right password
$
The tests shouldn't be printing any errors. Can you identify the problem?

Task 4: Double Linked List
Check out my implementation of a Double linked list in C (source code). But, there's a glitch...

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 main.c free_dlistint.c print_dlistint.c add_dnodeint_end.c delete_dnodeint_at_index.c -o delete_dnodeint
$ ./delete_dnodeint

... (more output)

$
The output of the double linked list operations is not correct. Can you pinpoint what's causing the issue?

Feel free to contribute your fixes to this repository. Let's work together to improve the code and make these programs run smoothly!
